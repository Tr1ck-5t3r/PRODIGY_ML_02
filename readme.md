# Prodigy Infotech Task 2

## Task Description

Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Deliverables

- A jupyter notebook containing the code for the K-means clustering algorithm
- A CSV file containing the dataset

## Results and Discussion

The K-means clustering algorithm was able to group customers into 5 clusters based on their purchase history. The customers were grouped based on their annual income and spending score.

They were succesfully clusstered in 6 clusters based on their annual income and spending score. The algorithm was able to identify the customers with high annual income and high spending score, as well as customers with low annual income and low spending score. This information can be used by the retail store to target specific customer segments with tailored marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

The K-means clustering algorithm was able to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The algorithm was able to identify 6 distinct customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. This information can be used by the retail store to target specific customer segments with tailored marketing strategies.
